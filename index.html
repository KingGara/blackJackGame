                    The objective of the game is to <b>beat the Dealer</b>. This can
                    be done by either <b>receiving cards that total a sum of 
                    21 (automatic win), OR by getting as close to 21 as possible, 
                    standing then allowing the Dealer to "BUST"</b>.
                    Game begins with Player & Dealer both being dealt two 
                    "hole" cards. Both the Players cards are dealt face up,
                    while only one of the Dealers cards is dealt face up.
                    Player acts first & can either <b>"STAND"</b> or <b>"HIT"</b>.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p id="blackJackHeader"> Actions </p>
                <p id="blackJackRules">
                    If Player choses to <b>"HIT"</b> they will recieve another card.
                    <b>All numeric cards 2-10 equal the given value, all face cards
                    equal 10 & aces can either equal 1 or 11</b> according to what
                    the Player wants. If at anypoint the sum of the cards dealt
                    to Player exceeds 21, the hand is over & the dealer wins.
                    <br><br>

                    If Player is satisfied with the sum of the hole cards or the
                    sum of all cards currently dealt, the Player can choose to
                    <b>"STAND"</b>. This means they forfeit thier ability to <b>"HIT"</b>
                    & whatever sum they currently have is what they will <b>"STAND"</b>
                    with against the Dealer.
