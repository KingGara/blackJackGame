                    The objective of the game is to beat the dealer. This can
                    be done by either receiving cards that total a sum of 
                    21 (automatic win), OR by getting as close to 21 as possible, 
                    standing then allowing the dealer to BUST.
                    Game begins with Player and Dealer both being dealt two 
                    "hole" cards. Both the Players cards are dealt face up,
                    while only one of the Dealers cards is dealt face up.
                    Player acts first & can either "STAND" or "HIT".
                </p>
                <br>
                <p id="blackJackHeader"> Actions </p>
                <p id="blackJackRules">
                    If player choses to "HIT" they will recieve another card.
                    All numeric cards 2-10 equal the given value, all face cards
                    equal 10 and aces can either equal 1 or 11 according to what
                    the player wants. If at anypoint the sum of the cards dealt
                    to player exceeds 21, the hand is over and the dealer wins.
                    <br><br>

                    If player is satisfied with the sum of the hole cards or the
                    sum of all cards currently dealt, player can choose to
                    "STAND". This means they forfeit thier ability to "HIT" and 
                    whatever sum they currently have is what they will "STAND"
                    with against the dealer.
